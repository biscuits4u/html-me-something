                    <p>I've played games since I was a little guy, on the computer and consoles.  I found Twitch in about 2012 through Starcraft tournaments.  I used to play Starcraft a lot as a kid and I really enjoyed watching high level professional play.  I was a viewer on Twitch for years before I decided in 2016 to go ahead and set up my own stream to broadcast my own gameplay.  I purchased the minimum amount of equipment necessary and got started in October 2016.  I played all different kinds of games and continue to do so today.  We have a great community of people who enjoy watching me struggle at playing video games.</p>

                    <h2>Schedule</h2>
                    <p>My schedule currently is all over the place.  My day job and Launch Code take up the majority of my time.  I try to stream twice a week.  I tweet out whenever I'm going live.</p>

                    <h2>Future Plans</h2>
                    <p>I would love to make a career out of streaming on Twitch but the field is very saturated.  It's not impossible but it will take a lot of time (a decent bit of luck) and hard work.  For now, I would like to expand my technical knowledge and find ways to incorporate what I'm learning in Launch Code to improve my channel.</p>
